Getting new user-defined premises in an environment

/-!
Here we define mechanisms that send new user-defined premises to the server.

The entire architecture is very WIP: it depends on several unreal assumptions
* If a user imports a module that is indexed by the server, the contents of the module is not changed
* After a user calculates the pretty-printed form of a premise, it will not be changed any more (because of caching)

/-- The data of a new premise sent to the server, including name and a signature consisting of docstring and type. -/

      Regarding `ppSignature`:
      * This is (probably) the same output as the `"decl"` in `constantInfoToJson` from `declarations.lean`
      * `ppSignature` is the bottleneck in preparing a list of new premises to send to the server
      * It usually takes ≤10ms, but can be much longer on constants with a complicated (TODO: in what way?) signature;
        for an example, see `set_option profiler true in #eval Premise.fromName ``ProbabilityTheory.integrable_kernel_prod_mk_left`
        or the tests
      * Using `pp.raw true` makes it very fast (on order of 1ms); see the logic inside `ppSignature` which uses `s!"{cinfo.type}"` when `pp.raw`
      * Therefore I think there are probably things inside `ppSignature` (`delabConstWithSignature`) that are
        unoptimized (there was no reason to optimize signature pretty-printing to less than 1ms, until now)
        and perhaps a custom version `ppSignature'` that cuts corners might be significantly faster

Serialize a declaration into a `Premise` by pretty-printing the declaration docstring and signature.

If `useCache := true`, this function is cached by `fromNameCacheRef`, so on the second time it is
called on the same declaration, it reads the previously stored result instead of calculates the signature again.
(**TODO**) This is just a temporary solution so that it is reasonable to call e.g. `aesop (add unsafe (by hammer))`
where `hammer` is called many times.
